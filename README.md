# Customer-Churn-Prediction

Churn is a problem that is faced by brands across multiple domains in industrial market segmentation such as E-Commerce, Telecom etc.
It is basically the process of losing customers to competition or due to some external factor incurred. 
This is basically a (classification) problem where the target variable is of two class variable with values Yes or No. 
The independent variables could be a mix of categorical or numeric variables. 
Applied multiple pre-processing techniques, exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithms to predict and 
reduce churn in this project.
